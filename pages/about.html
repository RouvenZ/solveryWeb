            <p class="sectionText"><b>This planet doesn’t need us. </b>It’s us who need a liveable planet. But we’ve been doing a bad job so far. That’s why we need an evidence-based, feasible plan to turn around climate breakdown and ecocide now. A plan for changing the way we work and produce. A plan that guarantees justice for all and leaves nobody behind. And a plan with how-tos: how to set up a food cooperative in a Spanish village, how to build a decentralized renewable energy system in a Polish coal-mining region, how to stop exploiting the Global South for our lithium batteries.</p>

            <h2 class="sectionTitle">Who we are</h2>
            <p class="sectionText"><b>We don't have a plan. </b>But there are millions of ideas out there. Millions of skilled and talented people, and a whole lot of committed activists. SOLVERY provides the one place where all this precious knowledge and energy can flow together, to be refined by the community and translated into concrete action and policies. What will emerge is a beautiful living, open access resource – a people’s plan.</p>
            <p class="sectionText"><b>SOLVERY is not just democratic. </b> It is radically bottom-up: nobody but the community will shape this plan. To collect the knowledge that’s out there, we use participatory tools and processes both analogue and digital, be it people’s assemblies or collaborative online workflows. We share the knowledge we need to build a fair and sustainable world for all of us. Welcome to our community: bring what you have, take what you need. Together we change. Together we win.</p>
